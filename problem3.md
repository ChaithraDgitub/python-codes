# Ant on Rail 

## Question
There is a ant on your balcony.It wants to leave the rail so sometimes it moves right and 
sometimes it moves left until it gets exhausted.Given an integer array A of size N which 
consists of integer 1 and -1 only representing ant's moves. 
Where 1 means ant moved unit distance towards the right side and -1 means it moved unit 
distance towards the left .Your task is to find and return the integer value representing how 
many times the ant reaches back to original starting position. 

## Note: 
- Assume 1-based indexing 
- Assume that the railing extends infinitely on the either sides

## Input Format:
- input1 : An integer value N representing the number of moves made by the ant. 

- input2 : 
 An integer array A consisting of the ant's moves towards either side Sample Input
